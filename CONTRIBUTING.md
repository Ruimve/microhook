Thanks for being willing to contribute!

## How should I write my commits?

Please assumes you are using [Conventional Commit messages][conventional-commit-message].

The most important prefixes you should have in mind are:
```
fix: which represents bug fixes, and correlates to a SemVer patch.
feat: which represents a new feature, and correlates to a SemVer minor.
feat!:, or fix!:, refactor!:, etc., which represent a breaking change (indicated by the !) and will result in a SemVer major.
```
